Description:

Tweeter is a Ruby on Rails app that will enable users to send and read
short messages called "tweets". Registered users can read and post tweets,
but those who are unregistered can only read them.

Tweeter will consist of users and their associated microposts. In a way, it will
try and be a minimalist Twitter-style application.
